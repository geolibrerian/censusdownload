# censusdownload
Download Public Census Data 

These scripts have been created to facilitate the download of US Census data. They take zip files from the census.gov site and download them using urllib2, and save them locally to the outfolder.

Adjust the outfolder variable to fit your local system. 

Requires Python 2.7 and nothing more.
